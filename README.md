**Business Problem**  
Aerofit is on a mission to better understand our customers and provide personalized treadmill recommendations for new buyers. We’re diving into the data to identify the key factors that set our treadmill models apart. Our objectives are:

1. To conduct descriptive analysis and build customer profiles for each Aerofit treadmill, represented with insightful charts and tables. 
2. To create two-way contingency tables and compute both conditional and marginal probabilities to gain deeper insights into how these patterns impact our business.

In this repository, you will find Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the data exploration process. By following the steps, you’ll be able to:

- Import and explore the dataset to understand its structure and key features.  
- Identify outliers using box plots and descriptive statistics.  
- Investigate the influence of factors like marital status and age on treadmill purchases.  
- Calculate and display marginal probabilities.  
- Analyze correlations between various factors using heatmaps and pair plots.  

By completing this analysis, you’ll be able to answer questions such as, “What’s the probability that a male customer will buy the KP781 treadmill?” and segment customers based on their preferences and behavior.
